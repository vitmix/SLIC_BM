# SLIC_BM
Software for calculating disparity/depth maps of stereo images 

Development of a solution for getting depth maps of stereo images with minimal preparations based on own algorithm for stereo matching. The designed algorithm uses superpixel segmentation (SLIC), that helps to enhance quality and acuity of resulting disparity\depth maps and gives an opportunity to move from physical pixels to superpixels - clusters of pixels with similar properties and operate on those level.
